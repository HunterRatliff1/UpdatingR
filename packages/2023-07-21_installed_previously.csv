acepack,1.4.1,2016-10-29,R 4.2.0,CRAN,ACE and AVAS for Selecting Multiple Regression Transformations,"Two nonparametric methods for multiple regression transform selection are provided.
  The first, Alternative Conditional Expectations (ACE), 
  is an algorithm to find the fixed point of maximal
  correlation, i.e. it finds a set of transformed response variables that maximizes R^2
  using smoothing functions [see Breiman, L., and J.H. Friedman. 1985. ""Estimating Optimal Transformations
  for Multiple Regression and Correlation"". Journal of the American Statistical Association.
  80:580-598. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1985.10478157>].
  Also included is the Additivity Variance Stabilization (AVAS) method which works better than ACE when
  correlation is low [see Tibshirani, R.. 1986. ""Estimating Transformations for Regression via Additivity
  and Variance Stabilization"". Journal of the American Statistical Association. 83:394-405. 
  <doi:10.1080/01621459.1988.10478610>]. A good introduction to these two methods is in chapter 16 of

Amelia,1.8.0,2021-05-26,R 4.2.0,CRAN,A Program for Missing Data,"A tool that ""multiply imputes"" missing data in a single cross-section
  (such as a survey), from a time series (like variables collected for
  each year in a country), or from a time-series-cross-sectional data
  set (such as collected by years for each of several countries).
  Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives
  essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches,
  is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can
  handle many more variables.  Unlike Amelia I and other statistically
  rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please
  let us know if you find to the contrary!).  The program also
  generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series
  across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors
  that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values
  of missing cells in their data.  Amelia II also includes useful
  diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models.  The program
  works from the R command line or via a graphical user interface that
  does not require users to know R."

    Other model selection criteria include AIC, BIC and Empirical Bayes 
    estimates of g. Sampling probabilities may be updated based on the sampled
    models using sampling w/out replacement or an efficient MCMC algorithm which
    samples models using a tree structure of the model space 
    as an efficient hash table.  See  Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010) 
    <DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049> for  details on the sampling algorithms.
    Uniform priors over all models or beta-binomial prior distributions on
    model size are allowed, and for large p truncated priors on the model
    space may be used to enforce sampling models that are full rank.  
    The user may force variables to always be included in addition to imposing
    constraints that higher order interactions are included only if their 
    parents are included in the model.

The response variable can be binomial, Gaussian, multinomial, Poisson or zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), and spatial autocorrelation is modelled by a set of random effects that are assigned a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. A number of different models are available for univariate spatial data, including models with no random effects as well as random effects modelled by different types of CAR prior, including the BYM model (Besag et al. (1991) <doi:10.1007/BF00116466>), the Leroux model (Leroux et al. (2000) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-1284-3_4>) and the localised model (Lee et al. (2015) <doi:10.1002/env.2348>). Additionally,  a multivariate CAR (MCAR) model for multivariate spatial data is available, as is a two-level hierarchical model for modelling data relating to individuals within areas. Full details are given in the vignette accompanying this package. The initial creation of this package was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant RES-000-22-4256, and on-going development has been supported by the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) grant EP/J017442/1, ESRC grant ES/K006460/1, Innovate UK / Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) grant NE/N007352/1 and the TB Alliance.

  shrinkage estimators for partial correlations and partial variances.  
  The inverse of the covariance and correlation matrix

The package contains furthermore functions to produce documents using MS Word (or PowerPoint) and functions to import data from Excel. Many of the included functions can be found scattered in other packages and other sources written partly by Titans of R. The reason for collecting them here, was primarily to have them consolidated in ONE instead of dozens of packages (which themselves might depend on other packages which are not needed at all), and to provide a common and consistent interface as far as function and arguments naming, NA handling, recycling rules etc. are concerned. Google style guides were used as naming rules (in absence of convincing alternatives). The 'BigCamelCase' style was consequently applied to functions borrowed from contributed R packages as well."

    local machine, in parallel a set of local machines, or distributed
    on a mix of local and remote machines.
    Extensions to this package implement additional backends for
    processing futures via compute cluster schedulers, etc.
    Because of its unified API, there is no need to modify any code in order
    switch from sequential on the local machine to, say, distributed
    processing on a remote compute cluster.
    Another strength of this package is that global variables and functions

    borders and in international waters, however speed comes at the cost of accuracy - near time 
    zone borders away from populated centres there is a chance that it will return the incorrect
    time zone. The other method is slower but more accurate - it uses the 'sf' package to intersect 
    points with a detailed map of time zones from here: 
    <https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/>. The package also 
    contains several utility functions for helping to understand and visualize

The code for stable and efficient computation of multinomial coefficients comes from Dave Barber. The code can be download from <http://tamivox.org/dave/multinomial/index.html> and is distributed without conditions. The package also generates the integer partitions of a positive, non-zero integer n. The C++ code for this is based on Python code from Jerome Kelleher which can be found here <https://jeromekelleher.net/category/combinatorics.html>.

  flexible tool for creating cutoff-parameterized 2D performance curves
  by freely combining two from over 25 performance measures (new
  performance measures can be added using a standard interface).
  Curves from different cross-validation or bootstrapping runs can be
  averaged by different methods, and standard deviations, standard
  errors or box plots can be used to visualize the variability across
  the runs. The parameterization can be visualized by printing cutoff
  values at the corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the
  curve according to cutoff. All components of a performance plot can
  be quickly adjusted using a flexible parameter dispatching
  mechanism. Despite its flexibility, ROCR is easy to use, with only
  three commands and reasonable default values for all optional
  parameters."

Relative risk and odds ratio estimates are also reported for binary outcomes. Missingness in the outcome is allowed, but not in treatment assignment or baseline covariate values.  The population mean is calculated when there is missingness, and no variation in the treatment assignment. The tmleMSM() function estimates the parameters of a marginal structural model for a binary point treatment effect. Effect estimation stratified by a binary mediating variable is also available. An ID argument can be used to identify repeated measures.

    <https://www.tmwr.org/>). In order to try different combinations of
    these, an object can be created that contains many workflows. There
